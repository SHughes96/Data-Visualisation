# Data-Visualisation

This repository is designed to highlight examples of the data visulisations that I have created over the course of my career. Many of these examples are from my PhD thesis and includes:
- Sigma clipping of data extracted from my calibration database
- Least squares fitting over a 2D to create surface maps
- Spline fitting of data and residual plotting
- Vector diagrams displaying instrument concepts

There is also a folder containing posters I created and presented at the SPIE astronomical telescopes and instrumentation 2022 conference.
